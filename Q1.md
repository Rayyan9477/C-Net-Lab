### **Question 1: Transmission Impairments [2.5 + 2.5 = 5 Marks]**

A data signal of 10 Mbps is transmitted over a copper cable with an attenuation of 6 dB per kilometer.

#### **Part 1: Calculate the power loss if the cable length is 5 km.**

**Step 1: Understand attenuation**  
Attenuation represents the loss of signal power as it travels through the cable, typically measured in decibels (dB). Here, the attenuation is given as 6 dB per kilometer, and the cable length is 5 km.

**Step 2: Calculate total attenuation**  
The total attenuation over the cable length is the attenuation per kilometer multiplied by the length of the cable:  
\[
\text{Total attenuation} = \text{Attenuation per km} \times \text{Length} = 6 \, \text{dB/km} \times 5 \, \text{km} = 30 \, \text{dB}
\]

**Step 3: Interpret power loss**  
In communication systems, power loss is often expressed as the total attenuation in dB, which indicates the reduction in power intensity from the input to the output. The formula relating input power (\(P_{\text{in}}\)) and output power (\(P_{\text{out}}\)) to attenuation in dB is:  
\[
\text{Attenuation (dB)} = 10 \times \log_{10}\left(\frac{P_{\text{in}}}{P_{\text{out}}}\right)
\]  
Here, the attenuation is 30 dB, so:  
\[
30 = 10 \times \log_{10}\left(\frac{P_{\text{in}}}{P_{\text{out}}}\right)
\]

**Step 4: Verify the power ratio (optional)**  
Solving for the power ratio:  
\[
\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_{\text{in}}}{P_{\text{out}}}\right) = \frac{30}{10} = 3
\]  
\[
\frac{P_{\text{in}}}{P_{\text{out}}} = 10^3 = 1000
\]  
\[
\frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}} = 10^{-3} = 0.001
\]  
This means the output power is 0.001 times the input power, confirming a significant loss. However, in such problems, power loss is typically reported as the attenuation value in dB.

**Step 5: Conclusion**  
The power loss, expressed as the total attenuation, is:  
**Power loss = 30 dB**

#### **Part 2: If the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 20 dB, what is the channel capacity according to the Shannon capacity formula?**

**Step 1: Recall the Shannon capacity formula**  
The Shannon capacity formula gives the maximum theoretical data rate (\(C\)) of a noisy channel:  
\[
C = B \times \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]  
Where:  
- \(C\) is the channel capacity in bits per second (bps)  
- \(B\) is the bandwidth in hertz (Hz)  
- \(\text{SNR}\) is the signal-to-noise ratio (in linear scale, not dB)

**Step 2: Convert SNR from dB to linear scale**  
The SNR is given as 20 dB. To use it in the formula, convert it to a linear ratio:  
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}}
\]  
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{20}{10}} = 10^2 = 100
\]

**Step 3: Identify the bandwidth**  
The problem provides a data signal of 10 Mbps (10 megabits per second) but does not explicitly state the channel’s bandwidth (\(B\)). Bandwidth is required for the Shannon formula, and without it, a numerical answer isn’t possible. The 10 Mbps is the transmitted data rate, not the bandwidth, which depends on the channel properties and modulation scheme. Since no bandwidth is specified, we must express the answer in terms of \(B\).

**Step 4: Apply the Shannon formula**  
Substitute \(\text{SNR} = 100\) into the formula:  
\[
C = B \times \log_2(1 + 100) = B \times \log_2(101)
\]

**Step 5: Compute \(\log_2(101)\)**  
To find \(\log_2(101)\), use the base change formula:  
\[
\log_2(101) = \frac{\ln(101)}{\ln(2)}
\]  
Using approximate values (\(\ln(101) \approx 4.615\), \(\ln(2) \approx 0.693\)):  
\[
\log_2(101) \approx \frac{4.615}{0.693} \approx 6.658
\]  
So:  
\[
C \approx B \times 6.658 \, \text{bps}
\]

**Step 6: Conclusion**  
Since the bandwidth \(B\) is not provided, the channel capacity is:  
**Channel capacity = \(B \times \log_2(101) \approx 6.658B\) bits per second**  
(Note: Without a specific \(B\), a numerical value cannot be determined. If a bandwidth were intended, it might be a problem oversight.)

### **Question 2: Analog and Digital Signals Analysis [2.5 + 2.5 = 5 Marks]**

A periodic analog signal is defined by the equation:  
*(Note: The equation is missing from the query. I’ll assume a typical form, such as \(s(t) = A \sin(2\pi f t)\), and proceed generically. Please provide the equation for a precise answer.)*

Let’s assume a signal like \(s(t) = 5 \sin(2\pi \cdot 1000 t)\) (fundamental frequency 1000 Hz) as an example, since the equation isn’t given.

#### **Part 1: What is the bandwidth of this signal?**

**Step 1: Define bandwidth for an analog signal**  
For a periodic analog signal, bandwidth is typically the range of frequencies present. A pure sine wave has a single frequency, so its bandwidth is theoretically zero (a single spectral line). However, practical signals may include harmonics or be band-limited.

**Step 2: Analyze the assumed signal**  
For \(s(t) = 5 \sin(2\pi \cdot 1000 t)\):  
- Frequency \(f = 1000 \, \text{Hz}\) (since \(2\pi f = 2000\pi\))  
- This is a single-frequency signal with no additional harmonics unless specified.

**Step 3: Determine bandwidth**  
For a pure sine wave, the bandwidth is zero because it occupies a single frequency. If the signal were a sum of harmonics (e.g., a square wave), bandwidth would depend on the highest harmonic. Without the actual equation, assume a single tone:  
**Bandwidth = 0 Hz** (ideal case)

---

#### **Part 2: How many harmonics are present in the signal?**

**Step 1: Understand harmonics**  
Harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. A pure sine wave has only the fundamental (1 harmonic). Complex periodic signals (e.g., square waves) have multiple harmonics.

**Step 2: Analyze the assumed signal**  
For \(s(t) = 5 \sin(2\pi \cdot 1000 t)\), only the fundamental frequency (1000 Hz) is present.  
**Number of harmonics = 1**

**Step 3: Note**  
If the signal includes multiple terms (e.g., \(s(t) = \sin(2\pi f t) + 0.5 \sin(4\pi f t)\)), count the harmonic terms. Without the equation, I assume a single term.

---

*(Please provide the signal equation for accurate bandwidth and harmonic analysis.)*

### **Question 3: Nyquist and Shannon Theorem [2.5 + 2.5 = 5 Marks]**

A digital communication system has a bandwidth of 4 MHz and an SNR of 30 dB.

#### **Part 1: Determine the maximum data rate using Nyquist’s theorem assuming a four-level signaling scheme.**

**Step 1: Recall Nyquist’s theorem**  
For a noiseless channel, the maximum data rate is:  
\[
R = 2 \times B \times \log_2(M)
\]  
Where:  
- \(R\) is the maximum data rate (bps)  
- \(B\) is the bandwidth (Hz)  
- \(M\) is the number of signaling levels

**Step 2: Assign given values**  
- \(B = 4 \, \text{MHz} = 4 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}\)  
- \(M = 4\) (four-level signaling)

**Step 3: Compute \(\log_2(M)\)**  
\[
\log_2(4) = 2 \quad (\text{since } 2^2 = 4)
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the data rate**  
\[
R = 2 \times 4 \times 10^6 \times 2 = 16 \times 10^6 \, \text{bps} = 16 \, \text{Mbps}
\]

**Step 5: Conclusion**  
**Maximum data rate = 16 Mbps**

---

#### **Part 2: Calculate the channel capacity using Shannon’s theorem.**

**Step 1: Recall Shannon’s theorem**  
\[
C = B \times \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

**Step 2: Convert SNR to linear scale**  
Given \(\text{SNR} = 30 \, \text{dB}\):  
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{30}{10}} = 10^3 = 1000
\]

**Step 3: Substitute values**  
- \(B = 4 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}\)  
- \(\text{SNR} = 1000\)  
\[
C = 4 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 1000) = 4 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1001)
\]

**Step 4: Compute \(\log_2(1001)\)**  
\[
\log_2(1001) = \frac{\ln(1001)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{6.907}{0.693} \approx 9.965
\]

**Step 5: Calculate capacity**  
\[
C = 4 \times 10^6 \times 9.965 \approx 39.86 \times 10^6 \, \text{bps} = 39.86 \, \text{Mbps}
\]

**Step 6: Conclusion**  
**Channel capacity = 39.86 Mbps**
